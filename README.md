# Katie Eary's Real Monsters NFT project

Katie Eary's Real Monster is a unique NFT project that brings together the physical and digital worlds in a creative and innovative way. As the only developer on this project, I was responsible for building the frontend and the smart contract.

The Real Monsters consists of 10 types of monsters, each with 1000 unique variations and 50 "truly rotten" examples. Each monster is available for purchase as an NFT and comes with a physical figurine that will be delivered to your address. These figurines are unique, limited edition pieces created by Katie Eary, and will not be reproduced.

Katie Eary is a well-established British designer known for her celebrity collections and visionary designs. Her concept for the Real Monsters was to create a tangible representation of a strong female-led ideology and involve the community in collecting and trading these monsters. The monsters are made from silicone, with material and color playing a paramount role in the designs.

The project promotes the idea that women can create anything they imagine, no matter how small the start. Owning a Bestiary monster in both the physical and digital worlds is a unique way to celebrate this idea.

As the only developer on this project, I built the frontend(NextJS & Tailwind) and the smart contract. The smart contract enables the creation, ownership, and trading of these unique NFTs. The frontend provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for users to view and purchase the monsters.

Please note that the Bestiary project is no longer active and is available on GitHub for educational purposes only.
